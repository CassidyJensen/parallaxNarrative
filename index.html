    <h1>Iceland Traveller</h1>
  </header>

  <main>
    <section>
      <p>I am lucky enough to be someone who has gotten many opportunities to travel around the world. One of my favorite trips was the one I took to Iceland with just my parents. We traveled around the ring road to learn about and see as much of Iceland as possible. By the end of the trip we were all a little sick of each other because it was a lot of hours in the car, but the experience was overall incredible. The following accounts most of the activities from our trip and what the experience was like. If you’re ever looking to go to Iceland someday, maybe this will help.  
      </p>
      <h2>Blue Lagoon</h2>
      <p>Our first day in Iceland was short, as travel days often are. After getting off the plane, we headed straight to the Blue Lagoon, the most infamous tourist attraction in Iceland. Although perhaps a bit overpriced, it was a wonderful way to start the vacation. We spent almost 2 hours soaking in the warm waters and drinking the refreshments. It was here that my dad and I were introduced to our favorite drink of the trip: Somersby Apple Cider. (Unfortunately they only sell it in 12 states in the U.S. and Colorado is not one of them). After leaving the lagoon we went to Reyjavik. Since we went in the summer, there were extra hours of sun which made us feel a little less tired. We explored the local area for an hour or two before finally drawing the blinds in our room and heading to bed.

      <h2>Golden Circle</h2>
      <p>A new day, another tourist attraction. The golden circle is one of the most traditional places to see when one visits Iceland, so obviously we had to do it. There are three main attractions on the circle: Thingvellir National Park, the Geysir Geothermal Area, and Gullfoss waterfall. All conveniently located to see it all in a day. Thingvellir was interesting for the historical prominence and it was really cool that they offered scuba diving along the divide. My mom and I tried to convince my dad to do it (he was the only one certified), but he was worried it would be too cold. The Geysir was a busy area, out of all the sites we saw in Iceland I disliked the crowded nature of this one the least. At least it is a quick adventure. You walk along the path, stand around the geysir for about 10 minutes, admire the power as it finally releases, snap a quick picture, and then you’re on your way. Gullfoss was easily the most impressive part of the golden circle and I’m glad we saved the best for last. The waterfall is incredibly stunning and even though the pictures are decent, they can’t even begin to capture how it feels to be there.

      <h2>Fire and Water... and Felix</h2>
      <p>
        Our third day we spent in Vik, in the area around a farmhouse turned guesthouse. The owners were friendly and had even baked fresh cookies when we arrived. They had a dog named Felix who liked to chase an old soccer ball that was way too big for him. This was the best place we stayed in Iceland and I mostly attribute that to Felix. For our sight-seeing activities we explored the South coast. We went to our first black sand beach in hopes of seeing Puffins, but the elusive creatures were not to be found. We then visited another big waterfall, which allowed us to walk behind it. It was cool, although definitely a big cold. It was here we began taking our traditional silly photos. These traditional photos consist of my dad jumping in the air looking excited and me looking bored into the distance. These were started because my cousin said it was a meme thing to do. Finally, we visited the Lava Center. It was a museum about the volcanoes on Iceland. Although I do not consider myself a big museum person, the exhibit was really impressive. It was dark, immersive, and cool. The whole thing exuded the aura of a volcano’s power. After leaving there we returned to pet Felix before getting some sleep.

      <h2>Stone Cold Ice</h2>
      <p>Leaving Felix and the farmhouse, we continued around the ring road. Along the way we stopped at a little rock outcropping that was where the trolls liked to live. It was a great place to break and stretch the legs, but unfortunately we did not sport any trolls. Perhaps someone else will have better luck. From there we continued to the glaciers. There were two stops. One was viewing the actual glacier. It was massive, but there were also chunks of it that had fallen into the lake. When the ice breaks it makes a terrifying sound, but I suppose we were lucky enough not to hear it. Though I still think it would’ve been cool. The second stop was down by the beach, where the chunks of glaciers float down the river and sometimes was up onto the black sand beach. This area is sometimes called “diamond beach” because the sunlight on the glaciers makes it glitter. However, we were there on a cold cloudy day. The ice was still pretty though.

      <h2>Fjords and Falls</h2>
      <p>This day was spent mostly driving along the fjords. It was a lot of back and forth, up and down, but they were pretty to see. A lot of them had mini waterfalls that snaked along their sides. We also stopped at a couple of smaller waterfalls. They weren’t Gullfoss, but they were fun to see in a very different way. There was one sheltered one we visited where nobody else was. We almost thought we were at the wrong place. The little falls up front were cute, but there was more to see in the distance. My parents were tired, so they had me venture forwards alone. It was farther than I thought, but I found the secluded main waterfall part. It wasn’t huge, but it was probably one of the prettiest. I also liked that I was alone there. As if it was a secret that only I was in on. After I returned to the car and shared my pictures we headed to another hot springs. This one was more like a public pool, which was a fun experience. After finishing there we went to our next guesthouse.

      <h2>Fire and Fumes</h2>
      <p>On this day we visited the myvatn volcanic area. Our first stop was at the crater lake that (if I remember correctly) was called “hell crater”. You could walk around the edge of the crater, but it was admittedly pretty steep. I liked the challenge, but my parents were a little more nervous about it. The lake had an incredible blue that sharply contrasted the red of the surrounding earth. It was weirdly pretty in that way. We then stopped at the Krafla Power Station for a bathroom break. They had a surprising amount of information in the front area, almost like a mini museum. It was very informative and made the stop a bit more fun. Next we visited the mud pots area. Although kinda cool, we didn’t stay long because the smell was a bit strong. It was hard not to gag. We ended the day in Akureyri, the only place we managed to catch the beautiful sunset.

      <h2>Tunnels and Towns</h2>
      <p>Our 7th day was spent mostly driving. We passed through a lot of little towns and went through a lot of tunnels. The tunnels were particularly interesting because they were almost all one lane. This made them a little bit extra confusing and stressful for us unfamiliar tourists. We were also a little sick of driving and each other at this point so it wasn’t our best day. Our one notable stop was in a town which called itself the home of Snow White. There was a cute bakery we stopped at for lunch. I should note, since we spent so much time driving, that I was originally really impressed to see the speed limit signs were 90. With all the long days of driving, I was excited by the idea of covering a lot of ground quickly. Unfortunately, I later realized it was not 90mph… It was 90 km. The actual speed was around 55mph.  Still good, but not as great as I originally had thought.

      <h2>Tours and Weddings</h2>
      <p>Our last few days of Iceland kind of blurred together. We were actually there for a wedding, but we had tagged on an extra week to explore Iceland beforehand. The family of the bride arranged a local area tour with a couple different stops. We finally went to see the Icelandic horses. We did not get the chance to ride them, but they were good at posing for selfies. They also gave us our first taste of lava bread. Which is made by putting ingredients in an old milk carton, stuffing it under ground in a geothermal area to cook, digging it out and serving it with butter. It was really good and I definitely ate as many pieces as I could get my hands on. The tour took us to another waterfall, geothermal spa, a crater, and also a secret cove called “paradise”. I was a little tired at this point, but I’m still not sure why it got the name paradise. Finally we went to the wedding, which was nice and had a few traditional Icelandic elements. The food was excellent. It was a good note to end our Icelandic trip.
